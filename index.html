        The Department of Computer Sciences at Quaid-i-Azam University is considered as one of the best computer science
        departments in Pakistan.
        The department is ranked among the top 3 departments in the country as per QS and Times Higher Education (THE)
        rankings.
        It was established at Quaid-i-Azam University Islamabad in 1976. The main objective of the department is to
        produce Computer Scientists
        in order to meet the growing demand for computer professionals in the country. All the programs have been highly
        successful.
        Department graduates have attained higher degrees from developed countries and are working in national and
        international organizations.
        The department offers PhD (Computer Science), MPhil (Computer Science), MS (Information Science & Technology),
        MS (Data Science), and
        BS (Computer Science) degrees. Each degree program has a specific objective and focus. The course of study and
        syllabus for each degree
        is updated and is inline with its objectives.
