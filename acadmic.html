          <strong>PhD</strong> is the highest degree awarded in an academic discipline and is the most rewarding
          educational experience. Students work closely with a faculty member, performing original research and tackling
          challenging, unsolved problems.

          The <strong>BS Computer Science program </strong> at QAU provides a well-integrated balance of theoretical and
          practical
          knowledge required for developing reliable and usable software tools for different fields. The program enables
          students to design, implement and manage systems combining scientific, computational, communication and
          multimedia facilities in different domains. The main objective of the program is to provide students with a
          balanced breadth and depth of knowledge in Computer Science that enables them to begin their professional
          career in the software industry or they can continue their education at graduate level. In the final three
          semesters, students enhance their skills and knowledge in one of the following focus areas:
